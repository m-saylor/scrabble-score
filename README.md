# Scrabble Duel

## What is Scrabble Duel?
Scrabble Duel is a command-line program in C that computes the Scrabble score of two words, disregarding the words' placement on a hypothetical board. This program computes the raw score of a word, regardless of bonuses like "triple letter score" or "double word score." Then, the program prints the winner, between Player 1 and Player 2.

## Why Scrabble Duel?
Scrabble Duel allows for a short vocabulary game against two players, with the RNG removed. Factors that leave a Scrabble game to luck--like a player's random assortment of letters, a board position, and board bonuses--have been eliminated. In Scrabble Duel, Scrabble becomes a strictly skill-based game. Additionally, Scrabble Duel helps you calculate the highest raw score of a word, which can improve your knowledge of high-scoring words for future gameplay. Test out some words before you play next time, and grow your high-scoring Scrabble vocabulary!

## Usage
First, download the [CS50 library](https://github.com/cs50/libcs50/releases) and follow these [instructions](https://github.com/madison-nicole/libcs50). The code must then be compiled.

You can use this program by inputting "./scrabble" into the command line and responding with player 1's input and player 2's input when prompted by the program. The program will print a winner or a tie.
